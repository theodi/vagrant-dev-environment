Release early, release often
============================

There's not much here right now, however it does work. You'll need a client key and the validator key from the ODI's Chef server, which shouuld go into ```.chef/```, then:

    bundle
    vagrant up

(I'm presuming you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, of course)
